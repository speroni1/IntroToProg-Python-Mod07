##**Discussion** 
•	What are the benefits of putting built-in Python command into functions? 
    o	You don’t hae to recreate things that exist, it makes the code more portable and easier for other people to understand
•	What are the benefits of using structured error handling? 
    o	Its easier than creating a whole new error handing method, and its easier to port and for other people to understand. 
•	What are the differences between a text file and a binary file? 
    o	A text file is written in common English (or whatever appropriate language) a binary file uses bytes which are often viewed as ascii characters which     do not correspond to readable text. 
•	How is the Exception class used? 
    o	To handle errors caused by user input, or other changes users might make to the code. Provides more 
•	How do you "derive" a new class from the Exception class? 
    o	You can take the other exception classes to catch more specific types of errors. When the except block finds a matchin class it uses that. 
•	When might you create a class derived from the Exception class? 
    o	When you want to catch more specific errors
•	What is the Markdown language? 
    o	A way of writing product documentation
•	How do you use Markdown on a GitHub webpage? 
    o	A way of formatting the webpage

## Document Your Knowledge
I took the ToDo list from the last class and added in the pickling and exceptions. I made a specific action to make a test faile. This works pretty similarly to C++, although I’m not aware of a parallel for the pickle function.
